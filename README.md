# Laravel + Passport Skeleton

## Working from this skeleton

You should fork this repository before working with it.

You'll need [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)


Once forked and cloned on your local development machine, run ```composer install```

Whenever you start working on your project : ```vagrant up```

When done : ```vagrant halt```


## What comes bundled with this repository

* Oauth2 server provided by laravel/passport.
* Simple Session API built on top of Oauth2 server
* Basic User model
* Custom composer scripts

## Composer scripts

All scripts must run inside Homestead or production environment:

* ```composer run-script test```  : run unit & feature tests
* ```composer run-script setup``` : setup application, install passport
* ```composer run-script reset``` : reset application, migrate fresh database, run tests

## Automatic Homestead.yaml generation

Outside Homestead, each time you run ```composer install```, Homestead.yaml is
generated automagically and "post-root-package-install" script is run.
